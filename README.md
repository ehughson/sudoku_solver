# sudoku_solver
Code for CMPT827 project that will use various path finding algorithms /search algorithms to solve the puzzle

Four puzzles were implemented:
- AC-3
- Backtracking
- Stochastic
- Hill-climbing

To run the algorithms through 4 various test cases run 'python3 main.py'

Important files:
- randomized_board.py creates a random sudoku board with a empty cell parameter that tells how many empty cells should be present in a given puzzle. 
- SudokuPuzzle.py creates the puzzle class instance and stores all useful information inorder to code all the different algorithms. 

Dependencies:
- NumPy
- Random 
- Math 
- Time
- queue
- sys
